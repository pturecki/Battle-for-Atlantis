I made this game orginally in Borland C++ 20 years ago.
Inspired by William Soleau Battle for Atlantis.

Now, after some fixes in a code, use VisualStudio 2019 to compile. Or make own solution with any other compiler (and maybe some new fixes in the code).

After compiling, copy generated exe file to Game folder. Or run from Visual Studio.

Have fun!
